# Grass - Creditworthiness Evaluation System

> **Available for Consultation:** As the developer of this system, I'm available for freelance projects implementing similar financial technology solutions for businesses. [Contact me](#contact) to discuss your needs.

## Project Overview

Grass is an advanced financial analytics tool that addresses one of the most significant challenges in global finance: **evaluating creditworthiness for the underbanked and those without formal credit histories**. Using sophisticated statistical models and machine learning techniques, this system provides holistic credit evaluation that goes beyond traditional credit scores.

## Key Capabilities

- **Alternative Credit Scoring**: Evaluates creditworthiness without requiring traditional credit history
- **Risk Assessment**: Implements the Black-Scholes-Merton model to calculate Probability of Default (PD)
- **Loss Prediction**: Advanced algorithms to predict Loss Given Default (LGD)
- **Loan Optimization**: AI-driven optimization of loan structures and installment plans
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adaptable to various demographic and regional contexts
- **Research-Backed**: Built on methodologies documented in published research

## Technical Implementation

The system currently leverages:
- **Statistical Modeling**: Implementation of the Black-Scholes-Merton model
- **Machine Learning**: Random forest regression models with scikit-learn
- **Data Pipeline Architecture**: End-to-end processing from raw financial data to credit decisions
- **Planned PyTorch Integration**: Transitioning to deep learning for enhanced prediction accuracy

## Real-World Applications

- **Microfinance Institutions**: Enable lending to clients without formal credit histories
- **Rural Banking**: Expand financial inclusion in developing regions
- **SME Lending**: Evaluate small business creditworthiness with limited financial records
- **Alternative Lending Platforms**: Power new credit products for underserved markets

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/grass.git
   cd grass
   ```

2. **Install Requirements:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate the Model:**
   ```sh
   mkdir models
   python model_generator/rf_lgd.py
   ```

## Implementation Example

```python
from grass import calculate_loan_metrics

# Example borrower with limited credit history
borrower = {
    "age": 30,
    "gender": "M",
    "annual_income": 50000,
    "monthly_expenses": 2000,
    "net_worth": 100000,
    "old_dependents": 1,
    "young_dependents": 2,
    "occupants_count": 3,
    "house_area": 1200
}

loan = {
    "loan_amount": 20000,
    "loan_tenure": 60
}

# Calculate comprehensive credit metrics
metrics = calculate_loan_metrics(borrower, loan, "./models/rf_lgd_pipeline.pkl")
print(metrics)
```

## Research Foundation

This project applies methodologies explored in published research on alternative credit scoring. The implementation leverages stochastic processes to model financial risk in ways that traditional credit systems cannot.

## Customization Options

The system can be customized for specific:
- Regional markets
- Demographic segments
- Financial product types
- Risk tolerance levels
- Regulatory requirements
